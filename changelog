	- JigsawHandler
	 - bug fix: if two edges (three corners) were completed together, drag allowance wasn't permitting the edge of the resulting connected set to be on the board.
	 - bug fix: Multi-select dragging allowed pieces to 'fall off' the edge and be lost. This was a result of negative width and heights in drag allowance calculations.
	- PuzzleCanvas
	 - Changed dragBuffer dimensions to allow for multi-select (pieces may be further apart)

2011 03 18 - Jon
	- GUI
	 - Removed game menu handling from GUI (GUI no longer has any direct interaction with PuzzleHandler)
	 - Started modifying code to work with PuzzleLoader instead of NewPuzzleDialog
	- PuzzleHandler
	 - Changed from interface to abstract class
	 - Integrated GameMenuHandler functionality
	 - Moved ui from PuzzleHandler implementations to PuzzleHandler (it is shared by all implementations)
	- Created PuzzleLoader - still a lot to do before it comes together
	- Deprecated GameMenuListener - all functions are in PuzzleHandler now.

2011 03 15 - Jon

2011 02 11 - Jon

  - New puzzle dialog comes up immediately after credits on game load.
 - JigsawHandler
  - Implemented tile rotation on click
  - Disabled arrow key scrolling due to interference with tile rotation.

2011 02 08 - Jon
 - PuzzleCanvas

--- New changes above this line ---

2010 08 11 - Jon
 - PuzzleCanvas
  - Changed background color logic
 - Updated credits
 - Prepared release candidate

2010 08 10 - Jon
 - documentation
  - Updated and built separate help files for each puzzle
  - Removed help->help and added help->Jigsaw, help->Sliding Tile, and help->Spinning Tile
 - makefile
   - updated and fixed broken/missing references
 - hulka.gui.GUILoader
  - Modified loadReader to correctly load the config file from within jar files.

2010 08 09 - Jon
 - NewPuzzleDialog:
  - Fixed OK button bug (button was enabled before any selections made)
 - JigsawHandler:
  - Adjusted for a quirk/bug:
    clicking on a menu, then click/dragging on the puzzle canvas fired a mouseUp with no mouseDown, causing mouseCount to become negative
2010 08 04 - Jon
 - hulka.util.ImageMap:
  - Added mean color to image specification (xml)
  - Added getMeanColor(int)
 - PuzzleCanvas:
  - Added setMeanColor (chooses a contrasting color for default background)

2010 07 29 - Jon
 - SpinnerHandler:
   - Added logic to check for completed puzzle
 - GUI
   - Added logic to disable and enable menu items

2010 07 27 Jon
 - hulka.tilemanager.HexJigsawManager: Cleaned up and moved most of the edge clipping functionality into randomize()
 - SliderHandler:
   - Abstracted tilemanager creation code to NewPuzzleDialog
   - This class now communicates with PuzzleCanvas, rather than GUI
 - SpinnerHandler:
   - Abstracted tilemanager creation code to NewPuzzleDialog
   - This class now communicates with PuzzleCanvas, rather than GUI

2010 07 26 - Jon
 - hulka.tilemanager.HexJigsawManager: Enhanced initTilesetDescriptor and getTileMask functions:
   Corner variance is now used for optimized tile sizing and edge adjustment.

 - hulka.tilemanager.SquareJigsawManager: Made tile size optimization code more consistent with HexJigsawManager

 - NewPuzzleDialog:
   - Modified event handler code to reset piece count when other selections change.
   - Changed default close ('x' button) behaviour to report no response (was defaulting to previous response).

 - PuzzleCanvas: Changed contrast color mapping (for selection box) to hsb(h+0.5,1-s,1-b) for better contrast

2010 07 09 - Jon
 - hulka.tilemanager.SquareTileManager: fixed tileHeight calculation in initTilesetDescriptor: changed from boardHeight/tilesAcross to boardHeigh/tilesDown
 - hulka.tilemanager.SquareJigsawManager: enhanced initTilesetDescriptor and randomize functions:
   Corner variance is now used for optimized tile sizing and edge adjustment.

2010 07 08 - Jon
- hulka.gui.GUILoader: Added <mask> element for menu items - now ctrl, alt, and shift can and must be specified explicitly

- Changed 'game' menu to 'file'
- Created 'puzzle' menu for game options
  - Layers
  - Background color
  - Preview
Moved control of layers and preview to menu level
Integrated color chooser for background color selection and made necessary changes to PuzzleCanvas and PuzzleHandler

- JigsawHandler: debugged second button click issues.
  Event handlers now keep a mouse count and only respond to the first mousePressed / last mouseReleased.
  As a result, second clicks have no effect. This modifies previous behaviour, where second clicks acted as a mouseReleased.
- JigsawHandler: reworked drag constraints.
  Dragged tiles are now constrained by a dragAllowance rectangle that ensures each group is at least partly visible.

2010 07 07 - Jon
- JigsawHandler Implemented layers

2010 07 06 - Jon
- JigsawHandler Created temp variables for each function (Rectangles and Points).
  This will require a tiny bit more memory usage, but will make future maintenance much easier.

2010 06 29 - Jon
 - fixed MouseSensetiveShapeManager.getIntersectingShapes - was not sorting by z-order
 - fixed image centering in JigsawHandler.finishGame
 
2010 06 28 - Jon
 - Debugged multi-select

2010 06 27 - Jon
 - Modified tile dragging - now tiles cannot overlap edge of the board
 - Integrated multi-select

2010 06 27 - Jon
 - Started implementing multiselect

2010 06 18 - Jon
 - Added getBoardWidth and getBoardHeight to TileManager

2010 06 17 - Jon
 - Debugged ConnectedSet. Jisaw puzzle is once again stable.
 - Added isGameComplete and isGameSaved to PuzzleHandler interface
 - Changed tile snapping in Jigsaw over to ConnectedSet.

2010 06 16 - Jon
 - Began retrofitting JigsawHandler to use ConnectedSet - ConnectedSet requires some debugging
 
2010 06 14 Jon
 - Worked out tile placement issues for JigsawHandler.
 - Added focus request on JisawHandler mousedown.
 - Added preview dialog to PuzzleCanvas
 
2010 06 13 Jon

2010 06 11 Jon
 - Moved JBufferedCanvas to package hulka.gui and cleaned up to make more consistent
 - Created PuzzleCanvas to abstract the drawing functions from GUI
 - Restructured PuzzleHandler to communicate with PuzzleCanvas, rather than GUI - GUI is now under 200 lines of code, was over 500
 - Moved tilemanager creation code from PuzzleHandler implementations to NewPuzzleDialog - this code is in one class now, rather than three

2010 06 10 Jon
 - Changed JSimpleImageCombo to hide the popup menu as soon as the value is changed, in addition to on mouse click.
   Previously, the popup would interfere with other dialogs that registered ActionListeners opened in response to ActionEvents.
 - Eliminated StateHandler
 - Moved setup code from StateHandler and PuzzleHandlers into NewPuzzleDialog
 - Created GameMenuListener to handle load, save, new, and quit events

2010 06 09 Jon

- Upgraded menu building and handling code to use GUILoader (GUI and StateHandler)
- the Nimbus look and feel is now used, if available (GUI)
